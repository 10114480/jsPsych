        <h3>What is jsPsych?</h3>
        <p>
          jsPsych is a JavaScript based library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser.
          It defines a formal structure for assembling experiments using a variety of plugins, making it easy to
          create a new experiment with only a handful of lines of JavaScript. Experienced programmers will be able
          to add new plugins to define new building blocks forexperiments. With the increasing power of web
          technology and the flexibility of jsPsych, virtually any kind of behavioral experiment is possible.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it work?</h3>
        <p>
          The basic formula for using jsPsych is to define the structure of the experiment using a few lines of 
          JavaScript and then tell jsPsych to run the experiment. The description of the experiment is generated
          by assembling different plugins together. Each plugin defines a different kind of behavioral task that
          a subject can complete, like responding to a stimulus by pressing a key, reading instructions, or answering
          a survey question.
        </p>
        <h3>What plugins are available?</h3>
        <p>
          The project wiki contains <a href="https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki/List-of-Plugins">a list of 
          included plugins</a>. Documentation for each plugin is available from that list.
        </p>
        <h3>What if the plugin I need isn't available?</h3>
        <p>
          You can create your own plugin. The formal structure of a plugin is very flexible, making it possible
          to create a plugin that describes almost any kind of task you can imagine. If you create a plugin that
          would be useful for other people, consider adding it to jsPsych!
        </p>
