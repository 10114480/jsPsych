jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating behavioral experiments that run in a web browser. jsPsych creates a framework for defining experiments and provides a set of flexible plugins that create different kinds of tasks a subject could complete during an experiment. By assembling different plugins together and customizing the parameters of each, it is possible to create many different types of experiments.

Here is a simple example of how to use the instructions plugin:
<div display="flex">

<div markdown="1" style="width: 50%;">

```javascript









    var trial = {       
        type: 'instructions',     
        pages: [      
        'Welcome to the experiment. Click next to begin.',      
        '<div>In this experiment, you will view a ' +       
        'series of images and answer questions.<br>' +      
        'Answer with the keys "y" or "n".',     
        'Here is an example:<br><br> ' +        
        '<img src="img/age/of2.jpg"></img><br><br>' +       
        'Is this person OLD or YOUNG?'      
        ],        
        show_clickable_nav: true      
    }       

    jsPsych.init({      
        timeline: [trial],        
    });
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
```

This is an example of the image-keyboard-response plugin:
<div display="flex">

<div markdown"2" style="width: 50%;">

And for a slightly longer experiment example, here is a flanker experiment which uses the html-keyboard-response plugin:
<div display="flex">

Response times
--------------

Wondering if jsPsych can be used for research that depends on accurate response time measurement? For most purposes, the answer is yes. Response time measurements in jsPsych (and JavaScript in general) are comparable to those taken in standard lab software like Psychophysics Toolbox and E-Prime. Response times measured in JavaScript tend to be a little bit longer (10-40ms), but have similar variance. See the following references for extensive work on this topic.
