jsPsych
=======

jsPsych is a javascript library for running behavioral experiments in a web browser. It uses a modular structure so that new experiment types can be written as plugins to the core library. It was created by Josh de Leeuw and Drew Hendrickson at Indiana University.

Documentation
-------------

We are actively documenting the library in our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki). You can find information about the core library and the various plugins that are available.

Can I run my experiment with this?
----------------------------------

jsPsych can run a variety of experiment types, and experienced coders should have no problem writing a plugin for experiments that don't exist.
