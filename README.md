jsPsych
=======

jsPsych is a JavaScript library for creating and running behavioral experiments in a web browser. jsPsych simplifies the process of coding browser-based experiments by providing a set of flexibile plugins that define different kinds of tasks a subject could complete during an experiment. By assembling different plugins together and customizing the parameters of each, it is possible to create many different types of experiments.


Documentation
-------------

We are actively documenting the library in our [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki).
The wiki contains a [list of all of the available plugins](https://github.com/jodeleeuw/jsPsych/wiki/List-of-Plugins),
and working demos for each one are on the associated wiki page. If you want to get a sense of what jsPsych can do, 
trying some of the demos is a good place to start.
